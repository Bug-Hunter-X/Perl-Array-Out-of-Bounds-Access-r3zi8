This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an element in an array that is outside of its valid index range. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version that handles potential out-of-bounds access.  Always validate array indices before accessing elements to prevent unexpected errors and ensure program stability.
